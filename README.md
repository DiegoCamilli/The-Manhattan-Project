# Challenges
In this project there were many hurdles and new issuse we had to power throgh and learn to navigate. 

The following block of code is a Dynamic API enpoint in which we had to generate an encrypted hash, and concatonate with a time stamp in addition the API Keys.

---

function getMarvelResponse() {
  
  var ts = new Date().getTime();
  
  var hash = CryptoJS.MD5(ts + PRIVATE_KEY + PUBLIC_KEY).toString();

  var baseUrl = 'https://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/characters';
  var heroName = randomName(heroNameArray);
}

`fetch(fullUrl).then(function (response) {
    return response.json();
  }).then(function (mdata) {
	console.log(mdata)
	printMarvelResult(mdata);
  });`
